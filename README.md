Currently i'm trying to fiddle with the eggs stats so they:
* Take more time to spoil (to make the starting eggs feasible to be used).
* Take longer to hatch. I'm planning it to be ~7 days ingame (in RL, eggs take 21 days to hatch).
* They should only hatch if kept at an "incubator room" where the temperature is stable and in the same tight temperature range real eggs need, wich is between 37°C and 39°C (99 and 102 Fahrenheit).
If you know how to do it, please contribute with the project.
